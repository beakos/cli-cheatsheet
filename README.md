# Purpose and Outcome for cli-cheatsheet
This my personal repo of bash, Linux, Command Prompt and Powershell commands written down after using UNIX based systems and Windows DOS based systems. These commands below have commands written with the name of the program or function applicable to the command or program. 

I have noted these down to help me remember some of these commands when using the CLI, as transtioning from GUI based applications becomes hard to remeber every bash command that I need to use. So below I have noted some commands I have used or noted command arguments that I may forget and can revist this sheet to assist what command to use. 

I will be adding more to this cheatsheet. Commands used are at random times. Any requests please let me know.
