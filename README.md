# Purpose and Outcome for cli-cheatsheet
Lines of commands (bash, Linux, Command Prompt, Powershell, zsh, etc) written down after using various systems. These commands below have commands written with the name of the program or function applicable to the command or program. I have noted these down to help me remember some of these commands when using the CLI, as transtioning from GUI based applications becomes hard to remember every command that I need to use. So I have categorically noted some commands I have used to allow me to come back and reference.

I will be adding more to this cheatsheet as I go and also sanitise notetaking format.

Commands present in markdown files will slowly be intergrated into webpage.

# Current Status of Documents
This repository is currently under research, development and review.
- Research and note down most common commands used for CLI programs or executables.
- Group and collate commands into categories containing various scripts, arguments or executables etc.
- Integrate markdown files to website.
